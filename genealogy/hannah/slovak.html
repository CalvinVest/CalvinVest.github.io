                        The name Rusyn is derived from "Rus" (Ruthenia), the name of the territory that they inhabited.
                        The name Ruthenia (from the Latin Ruthenus/Rutheni) comes from a term found in medeival sources to
                        describe Slavic inhabitants, either Orthodox or Greek Catholic, living in the grand duchy of Lithuania or,
                        later, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rusyns are also known as Carpatho-Rusyns, referring to Carpathian Ruthenia. This region is generally comprised
                        of Subcarpathian Rus' in northeastern Slovakia and Ukraine's Zakarpattia Oblast, Prešov Region in eastern Slovakia,
                        the Lemko Region in southeastern Poland, and Maramureş in north-central Romania.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The variant Rusnak was also used as an endonym, particularly by the Rusyns outside the Carpathians in Vojvodina, Serbia
                        and Slavonia, Croatia. However, they may also be referred to as Vojvodinian Rusyns or formerly, as Yugoslav Rusyns. Other terms,
                        like Ruthene, Rusniak, Lemak, Lyshak, and Lemko are considered to be historic or synonymic names for these inhabitants of
                        Transcarpathia. Some also hold that Lemko and Rusnak are simply regional variations of Rusyns or Ruthenes.

                    <p>Rusyn origins are still a debated topic and multiple theories exist.</p>
                    <h3>Rusyn Origins</h3>
                    <p>
                        Their ancestors were the early Slavs whose arrival to the Danubian Basin was influenced by the Huns and the Avar Khaganate
                        in the 5th and 6th centuries A.D., the White Croats among both slopes of the Carpathian Mountains, the Rusyns of Galicia and
                        Podolia, and Vlach shepherds of Transylvania.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Kievan Rus'</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rusyn history more definitively starts with the first East Slavic state of Kievan Rus' from the late 9th to early 13th century.
                        The Carpathian Rusyns, Ukrainians, Belarussians, and Russians are all descended from the Russichi, the people of Rus'. These early
                        East Slavs mixed with other peoples across centuries, including Iranian, Germanic, Baltic, Finnish, and Turkic peoples throughout
                        Eastern Europe. The expanse of Kievan Rus' from the shores of the Black Sea in southern present-day Ukraine to Finland and northern
                        Slavic states was regarded as the "Rus' land" during its existence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before the developement of Kievan Rus', much of the land north of the Black Sea was populated by eastern Slavic tribes. There was
                        once controversy over whether the Rus' were Varangians (viking peoples from present-day Sweden) or Slavs. However, scholarly attention
                        has more recently focused on how quickly an ancestrally Norse people assimilated into Slavic culture. Much contemporary research and
                        debate of Rus' origin has periodically devolved into competing nationalist narratives promoted directly by various government bodies
                        in a number of states. This was demonstrated in the Stalinist period, when Soviets sought to distance the Rus' from any connection to
                        Germanic tribes, to dispel Nazi propoganda that the existence of the Russian state was reliant on a supposedly superior Norse ancestor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In any case, the connection between the Rus' and the Norse is confirmed both by the existence of Scandinavian settlement in Belarus,
                        Russia, and Ukraine, and by Slavic influences on the Swedish language. While there is still debate over the origin of the Rus', and much
                        of the research and discussion on the topic remains politically charged, there is broad agreement that if the proto-Rus' were indeed
                        originally Norse, they were quickly nativized, and adopted Slavic languages, culture, and customs.
