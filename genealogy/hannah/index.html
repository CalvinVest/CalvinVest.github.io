                    <h3>What I've found</h3>
                    <p>Much of my time researching Hannah's family history has been spent focused on her ancestors from the Carpathian Mountain region of present-day Slovakia.</p>
                    <p>
                        These ancestors were likely Rusyn people who immigrated from Slovak lands under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the early 20th century.
                        Early immigrant families settled in central and western Pennsylvania, and parts of Ohio.
                        I've dedicated my time to creating pages on this site in order to present the work I've done in discovering as much as I can of Hannah's family history.
                        Please enjoy.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Where it starts</h3>
                    <p>The first focal point for my research into the Slovak line of the family is Ann Gdula.</p>
                    <p>
                        Ann was born to Peter Gdula and Catherine Petrek-Ondescko c. 1917 in Pennsylvania.
                        She is the first natural-born ancestor in this branch of the family tree. Her father Peter immigrated to the United states in 1908.
                        His wife, Catherine, did the same three years later. The two of them married in Cambria County, Pennsylvania in 1914,
                        and would remain in the county for the rest of their lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ann is the second of eight children of Peter and Catherine's and their eldest daughter. She would remain with the family in Pennsylvania
                        until her marriage to William Gordon about 1946 in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. She remained in Cleveland and by the 1950 census is recorded with her
                        husband and two young sons. She and her husband would both die only a few years later in 1958.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How it's going</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's clear that Ann Gdula's ancestry comes from present-day Slovakia and were very likely Rusyn. Records and research get progressively more
                        difficult with every generation removed from Ann going backward, but I've set out to discover as much as I can about this branch. The two primary
                        branches of this line are the paternal Gdula line and maternal Petrek-Ondescko line. Both families seem to come from the Bardejov District in Slovakia.
                        This region was, at the time, under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Peter and Catherine likely came to the United States to flee the Hungarian
                        "Magyarization" (or Hungarianization) of minority ethnic groups including Slovaks and Rusyns under the influence of the Hungarians between the Austro-Hungarian
                        Compromise of 1867 and Austria-Hungary's dissolution in 1918.
                        Magyarization was perceived by some groups such as Romanians, Slovaks, Serbs, Croats, and Rusyns as culturally aggresive or actively discriminating, especially in
                        areas where national minorities formed the majority of the local population (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magyarization#Use_of_the_term" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A lot of the recent research I've done for the Gdula and Petrek-Ondescko lines has been sifting through 19th-century Slovak Synagogue records in Hungarian and
                        Latin cursive. It's been slow-going, but I'm hoping to find something that can give me a better picture of these families in the generations before their arrival in the
                        Unites States. Stay tuned to this page as I continue to research and contribute my findings here.
