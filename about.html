                    I've got a lot of resources I want to put on this site that I haven't categorized.
                    That's the purpose of the red pages.
                    All of the stuff I want to save here that doesn't really have a specific home yet.

                    <p>
                        This website is, simply, me. It's a whole lot of information about my hobbies, interests, achievements, research, records, and so much more all in one place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tabs along the top of the page will be your best navigator here.
                        Everything's accessible from most of the site, but some of the specific subsections might have specialized headers for their own categories.
                        I put MAD amounts of time into getting everything on this site laid out in a way that, at least to me, makes sense. CRAZY amounts time. RIDICULOUS even. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>What's the point?</h2>
                    <p>
                        It's ease of access. All of the stuff I could want to look at, all in a place that I can host from <em>anywhere</em>, in a format that's super easy to adventure through.
                        Call it my information-age attempt at a wizard tower far away where I can store all of my spells and incantations and fancy wizard stuff when I wanna look at it for reasons and stuff.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why a website, then?</h2>
                    <p>
                        So I can share it with <em>you!</em> And a bunch of other people, really.
                        Information's nothing if it's not available. I want to share what I've learned with the people I want to teach it to, in a way that makes learning it easy.
                        At its core, that's why this website's here. To share what I've learned about the world with the other people I'm sharing it with, to make it a little better.

                        I'm a computer scientist, a meat cutter, an electrician, a genealogist, a ham radio operator, a Star Wars fan, I own way too many video games, and I like tractors.

                    <h2>My Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've gone to school for engineering (mechanical and electrical), computer science, and I've taken all sorts of classes on math, science, the arts, literature, music, and more.
                        I can play a few instruments, but I mainly focus on guitar, banjo, piano, and mandolin.
                        I was in Scouting for most of my childhood, getting Eagle Scout a week before the 18th-birthday cutoff.
                        I was raised in the Protestant Christian Church, through several different denominations, and spent plenty of time in and around the Catholic Church
                        during my time in Scouts alongside chartered troops and fellow Scouts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've always had a passion for knowledge. There's always something more to learn about a subject, or other details to explore, and I love doing so.
                        Heck, the entire reason this website's here in the first place, far before I ever had some over-arching theme about wanting to spread knowledge and all that, was just because I wanted to learn how to make a website.
                        I made one - it sat here, collecting digital cobwebs, until I finally realized the power of the tool I had at my disposal. 
                        This website was empty for about four years before I ever really took some initiative and built it up to what you see now.

                        The cycle of knowledge as I've come to understand it has five parts:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unknowing</li>

                        <li>Understanding</li>

                        Every knowable thing begins in some form of the unknown. By exploring our surroundings, we gather valuable intelligence about the world that can create our context of it.
                        Research requires us to compare the intelligence we've collected amongst an array of prior context.
                        As new information is assessed, it expands the context that we ascertain about the world around us and its laws and principles.
                        By comparing all new knowledge against this intellectual frame of reference composed of works across many different fields, experiences, specialties, and qualifications, we can further refine our own understanding not just of the unfamiliar, but of that which is known already also.
                        This trial by which all information is processed and confirmed allows for a broader understanding of its subject and justifications for the validity of the data, its authorship, its authenticity, and its value.

                    <p>
                        The Scout Law was engrained into me, with weekly recitation and daily application, from early adolescence into early adulthood, and its affect has remained.
                        I firmly and wholy believe that this Law has become an integral part of who I've become as a person, largely just because of how often I'd think about it
                        whenever I'd be carrying out my everyday life. I constantly refer back to these points in my character and how I represent myself to others.

                        Anyways, it's a clear-cut twelve-point code that represents the tenets of what a true Scout should be. It starts "A Scout is..."
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trustworthy</li>
                        <li>Loyal</li>
                        <li>Helpful</li>
                        <li>Friendly</li>
                        <li>Courteous</li>
                        <li>Kind</li>
                        <li>Obedient</li>
                        <li>Cheerful</li>
                        <li>Thrifty</li>
                        <li>Brave</li>
                        <li>Clean</li>
                        <li>Reverent</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Even in the deepest points of my doubts of my religious faith and theistic beliefs, I could still find justification for adhering to all twelve points of this code
                        and stuck by them even more for it.

                    <h2>The Nicene Creed</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was raised Reformed Protestant Christian,
                        and resultantly I've always held some creeds close simply from my upbringing and the faith I was raised in,
                        regardless of my current day beliefs and how they've developed over time.
                        Nevertheless these creeds have remained with me, and they've shaped my own worldly lens on an intrinsic level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chief among these, albeit likely in tandem the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed was a consistent forerunner in my religious education and childhood instruction in my faith.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        I believe in one God,
                        the Father almighty,
                        maker of heaven and earth,
                        of all things visible and invisible.<br />

                        I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
                        the Only Begotten Son of God,
                        born of the Father before all ages.
                        God from God, Light from Light,
                        true God from true God,
                        begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;
                        through him all things were made.
                        For us men and for our salvation
                        he came down from heaven,
                        and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
                        and became man.
                        For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
                        he suffered death and was buried,
                        and rose again on the third day
                        in accordance with the Scriptures.
                        He ascended into heaven
                        and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
                        He will come again in glory
                        to judge the living and the dead
                        and his kingdom will have no end.<br />

                        I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
                        who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
                        who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,
                        who has spoken through the prophets.<br />

                        I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.
                        I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins
                        and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead
                        and the life of the world to come. Amen.

                    <h2>The Apostles' Creed</h2>
                    <p>
                        Same with the Nicene Creed, it's a frontrunner in my everyday childhood life and it's been a part of me as long as I've been me.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>

                        I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
                            who was conceived by the Holy Spirit
                            and born of the virgin Mary.
                            He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
                            was crucified, died, and was buried;
                            he descended to hell.
                            The third day he rose again from the dead.
                            He ascended to heaven
                            and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.
                            From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.<br />

                        I believe in the Holy Spirit,
                            the holy catholic* church,
                            the communion of saints,
                            the forgiveness of sins,
                            the resurrection of the body,
                            and the life everlasting. Amen. <br />

                    <h2>Annomor</h2>
                    <p>Hehe, this is where it gets a little cheesy but this one's my own thing.</p>
                    <p>
                        Annomor is an acronymic portmanteau of the latin motto
                        "<strong>AN</strong>tiquis reverentium, <strong>NO</strong>titiae custodium, a<strong>MOR</strong>i devotionem". To the ancients, reverence. To knowledge, guardianship. To love, devotion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Antiquis reverentium</em>, or "to the ancients, reverence", highlights my appreciation and interest in genealogy and religious history,
                        as cataloged and referenced within this site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Notitiae custodium</em>, "to knowledge, guardianship", is my belief that human insight and wisdom is to be procured, deliberated, refined,
                        vetted, sourced, and cited to the best of the ability of its stewards, so that it might serve to better the future through our inspection of the past.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Amori devotionem</em>, "to love, devotion", encapsulates the moral responsibility of those with knowledge to share it, in love, for the betterment of another.
                        In all knowledge and wisdom there is value, and in sharing this treasure with our neighbor and through good and proper stewardship of this knowledge
                        might we show our love for those we learn for.
                        To better the lives of those around us with all that we know and can learn, to leave this place better than we once knew it so that
                        it is only made better for your time in it.
